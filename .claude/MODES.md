# Development Modes

This document defines two structured development workflows for this project: **Spec Mode** and **Vibe Mode**. Each mode serves different project needs and team preferences.

---

## Mode Selection

At the start of each new task or feature request, use the AskUserQuestion tool to present mode options:

```javascript
AskUserQuestion({
	questions: [
		{
			question: 'Which development mode would you like to use for this feature?',
			header: 'Dev Mode',
			multiSelect: false,
			options: [
				{
					label: 'Spec Mode',
					description:
						'Structured approach with Requirements → Design → Tasks phases. Best for complex features, team collaboration, or when clear documentation is needed.'
				},
				{
					label: 'Vibe Mode',
					description:
						'Rapid implementation with minimal upfront planning. Best for prototypes, small features, or when speed is the priority.'
				}
			]
		}
	]
});
```

Wait for the user's response before proceeding.

## Mode Decision Matrix

Use this matrix to recommend the appropriate mode:

| Factor                   | Spec Mode                           | Vibe Mode                               |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Feature Complexity**   | High (multiple components, systems) | Low (single component, isolated change) |
| **Team Size**            | Multiple developers                 | Solo developer                          |
| **Documentation Needs**  | Required for handoff/review         | Minimal/none                            |
| **Timeline**             | Sufficient time for planning        | Urgent/tight deadline                   |
| **Requirements Clarity** | Unclear, needs exploration          | Well-understood                         |
| **Risk Level**           | High (affects core functionality)   | Low (experimental, easily reversible)   |

---

### Phase 3: Tasks Document

**Objective:** Break down the implementation into manageable, trackable tasks with visual progress tracking.

#### Document Structure

Based on approved requirements and design, create a tasks document with visual progress indicators:

1. **Visual Progress Header**

   ```markdown
   ## Progress Overview

   📊 **Overall Progress:** ▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░░ 60% (6/10 tasks completed)

   📍 **Current Phase:** Core Functionality
   ⏱️ **Last Updated:** 2025-01-24 14:30
   🎯 **Next Milestone:** Complete data layer (Tasks #7-8)

   ### Phase Breakdown

   - Track blockers and resolution in real-time

#### Gate 3: Tasks Review & Implementation Start

After creating the tasks document:

1. Save it to `docs/tasks/[feature-name].md`
2. Reference both requirements and design documents
3. Present to the user using AskUserQuestion:

```javascript
AskUserQuestion({
	questions: [
		{
			question:
				'Task breakdown is complete with visual progress tracking. Ready to begin implementation?',
			header: 'Gate 3',
			multiSelect: false,
			options: [
				{
					label: 'Start Implementation',
					description: "Tasks look good. Let's begin building and track progress in real-time."
				},
				{
					label: 'Adjust Task Order',
					description: 'I want to change the sequence or priority of tasks.'
				},
				{
					label: 'Break Down Further',
					description: 'Some tasks seem too large or complex.'
				},
				{
					label: 'Review All Docs',
					description: 'I want to review requirements, design, and tasks together.'
				}
			]
		}
	]
});
```

4. Once approved, begin implementation with **dual tracking:**
   - Use **TodoWrite tool** for in-session task tracking (temporary, fast)
   - Update **tasks document** after each task completion (permanent, detailed)

#### During Implementation: Live Document Updates

**CRITICAL:** The tasks document must be updated in real-time as work progresses:

1. **When Starting a Task:**
   - Mark status as `🔄 IN PROGRESS`
   - Add start timestamp
   - Update progress header to show current task
   - Example:

   ```markdown
   - [⚡] **Task #4:** Build Profile component ⏱️ 3h ← CURRENT
     - **Status:** 🔄 IN PROGRESS (Started 2025-01-24 14:30)
   ```

2. **During Task Execution:**
   - Update progress bar if task has subtasks (e.g., `▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░ 50%`)
   - Check off completion criteria as they're met
   - Add notes about implementation decisions or discoveries
   - Document any blockers immediately
   - Example:

   ```markdown
   - **Completion Criteria:**
     - [x] Component scaffolding complete
     - [x] Props interface defined
     - [ ] Render logic implemented ← working on this
   - **Current Work:** Implementing form validation logic
   - **Blockers:** None
   ```

3. **When Completing a Task:**
   - Change status to `✅ COMPLETED`
   - Add completion timestamp
   - Mark checkbox as `[x]`
   - Update progress header percentages
   - Add any final notes or learnings
   - Example:

   ```markdown
   - [x] **Task #4:** Build Profile component ⏱️ 3h
     - **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (2025-01-24 17:45)
     - **Notes:** Added additional loading state for better UX
   ```

4. **Update Progress Header:**

   ```markdown
   📊 **Overall Progress:** ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░ 70% (7/10 tasks completed)
   📍 **Current Phase:** Core Functionality
   ⏱️ **Last Updated:** 2025-01-24 17:45
   🎯 **Next Milestone:** Complete data layer (Task #8)
   ```

5. **When Blocked:**
   - Add blocker immediately to current task
   - Update status with warning icon
   - Example:
   ```markdown
   - [⚠️] **Task #5:** Add profile edit functionality
     - **Status:** ⛔ BLOCKED (2025-01-24 18:00)
     - **Blockers:**
       - Waiting for API endpoint deployment (Backend Team)
       - ETA: 2025-01-25 10:00
     - **Workaround:** Using mock data for development
   ```

#### Task Status Icons Reference

Use these visual indicators throughout the document:

- `[ ]` or `⏳` = Pending (not started)
- `[⚡]` or `🔄` = In Progress (currently working)
- `[x]` or `✅` = Completed (done)
- `[⚠️]` or `⛔` = Blocked (waiting on dependency)
- `[💡]` = Discovery (new task found during implementation)
- `[🔥]` = High Priority
- `[📌]` = Pinned (important reference)
- `[⏭️]` = Skipped (deferred to later)

#### Progress Visualization Guide

**Progress Bars:**

- Use `▓` for completed portions
- Use `░` for remaining portions
- Always show percentage: `▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░░ 60%`

**Phase Progress Example:**

```markdown
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Foundation [████████████] 100% (3/3) ✓ │
│ Core Features [████████░░░░] 66% (2/3) ← IN PROGRESS│
│ Polish & UX [░░░░░░░░░░░░] 0% (0/2) │
│ Testing [░░░░░░░░░░░░] 0% (0/2) │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Spec Mode Principles

- **Incremental:** Each phase builds on the previous with clear gates
- **Traceable:** Tasks → Design → Requirements form a clear chain
- **Testable:** Correctness properties map to acceptance criteria
- **Iterative:** Refine each document before moving forward
- **Collaborative:** Gates provide natural review and feedback points
- **Documented:** Creates lasting reference for future maintainers

### Spec Mode Best Practices

1. **Requirements Phase**
   - Focus on user value, not technical solutions
   - Include specific metrics for success
   - Get stakeholder alignment early

2. **Design Phase**
   - Map every requirement to design elements
   - Document why decisions were made
   - Consider edge cases and failure modes

3. **Tasks Phase**
   - Keep tasks atomic and independent where possible
   - Include testing tasks explicitly
   - Plan for incremental delivery

4. **Throughout All Phases**
   - Update documents as implementation reveals new information
   - Track decisions and rationale
   - Maintain bidirectional traceability

---

## VIBE MODE

When the user selects Vibe Mode, proceed with agile implementation:

### Workflow

1. **Quick Planning** (5 minutes)
   - Briefly understand the goal
   - Identify major components involved
   - Ask 1-2 clarifying questions if needed

2. **Rapid Implementation**
   - Jump straight into code
   - Make reasonable technical decisions on the fly
   - Use established patterns from the codebase
   - Focus on working code first, optimization later

3. **Iterative Refinement**
   - Get something working quickly
   - Show progress frequently
   - Adjust based on feedback
   - Refactor as you go if it improves clarity

4. **Minimal Documentation**
   - Code comments for complex logic only
   - No formal specification documents
   - Keep git commit messages descriptive

### When to Use Vibe Mode

- **Prototyping:** Testing ideas or proof of concepts
- **Small Features:** Simple, isolated changes
- **Bug Fixes:** Addressing specific issues
- **Urgent Work:** Time-critical implementations
- **Solo Development:** Working alone without handoff needs
- **Experimental Work:** Trying new approaches

### Vibe Mode Principles

- **Speed over perfection:** Ship working code quickly
- **Iterate rapidly:** Make changes based on real usage
- **Stay flexible:** Adapt to discoveries during implementation
- **Trust instincts:** Leverage experience for quick decisions
- **Keep it simple:** Avoid over-engineering

### Vibe Mode Best Practices

1. **Still write tests** for critical logic
2. **Follow existing patterns** in the codebase
3. **Ask quick questions** rather than making wrong assumptions
4. **Commit frequently** with descriptive messages
5. **Refactor obvious issues** as you encounter them

### Transitioning from Vibe to Spec

If a Vibe Mode feature grows in complexity, suggest transitioning to Spec Mode:

```javascript
AskUserQuestion({
	questions: [
		{
			question: 'This feature has grown complex. Would you like to formalize the approach?',
			header: 'Mode Switch',
			multiSelect: false,
			options: [
				{
					label: 'Switch to Spec Mode',
					description: 'Create formal requirements and design docs for remaining work.'
				},
				{
					label: 'Continue in Vibe Mode',
					description: 'Keep iterating quickly with minimal planning.'
				}
			]
		}
	]
});
```

## Appendix: Example Questions & Prompts

### Mode Selection Examples

**For Complex Features:**

> "This looks like a substantial feature touching authentication and data models. I recommend Spec Mode for proper planning. Which mode would you prefer?"

**For Simple Changes:**

> "This is a straightforward UI update. Vibe Mode would get this done quickly. Which mode works for you?"

**For Unclear Scope:**

> "I'm not sure of the full scope yet. Spec Mode would help us explore requirements, or we could prototype in Vibe Mode. What's your preference?"

### Phase Gate Examples

**Requirements Approval:**

> "I've documented 5 user stories with acceptance criteria, plus performance and accessibility requirements. Please review docs/requirements/user-profile.md. Ready to move to design?"

**Design Approval:**

> "The design includes a new ProfileService, 3 React components, and updates to the User data model. All acceptance criteria are mapped to correctness properties. Review docs/design/user-profile.md?"

**Tasks Approval:**

> "I've broken this into 12 tasks ordered by dependency. Each task should take 2-3 hours. The full breakdown is in docs/tasks/user-profile.md. Ready to start?"

### Mid-Implementation Questions

**Discovering New Requirements:**

> "While implementing, I discovered we need to handle social login providers. Should I update the requirements doc, or handle this as a follow-up task?"

**Technical Blockers:**

> "Task #5 is blocked by a missing API endpoint. Should we implement that first, or mock it for now?"

**Scope Creep:**

> "This could also include email verification, but that wasn't in the original requirements. Add to scope, or create a separate feature?"
